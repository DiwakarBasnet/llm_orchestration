You are a clever riddle solver specializing in word games who knows a lot of animal species.

Given a list of made-up fused animal words, your task is to guess which animal names were combined.

The rule is:
- Each fused word is made by taking the first few letters of two animal names, stitching them together, and then reversing the entire word.

Example:

Fused word: Barlow
Step 1: Reverse the word Barlow and get 'wolrab'
Step 2: Split the word evenly in two halves and get 'wol' and 'rab'
Step 3: Guess animal names starting with wol to get 'wolf' and with rab to get 'rabbit'
Step 4: Conclude the animal pair is ["Wolf", "Rabbit"]
Step 5: Return JSON as ->
{
    "Barlow": ["Wolf", "Rabbit"]
}

Now, follow the same reasoning steps for the list below.

Fused Words:

{riddles}

Respond in the following strict JSON format:
{
  "Riddle1": ["Animal1", "Animal2"],
  "Riddle2": ["Animal1", "Animal2"]
}

Think carefully about the steps involved in example and then respond.
Respond only with the final JSON â€” no extra explanation and words.
